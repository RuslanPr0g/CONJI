# Conji ðŸ–¤

Welcome to Conji! A fun project built with **Angular**!

[![CI](https://github.com/RuslanPr0g/CONJI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RuslanPr0g/CONJI/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[![CD](https://github.com/RuslanPr0g/CONJI/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RuslanPr0g/CONJI/actions/workflows/cd.yml)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

Start by cloning the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conji.git
cd conji
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the projectâ€™s dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Run the app locally with the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open your browser and visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app should automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

### 1. Code scaffolding

Need a new component, service, or module? Angular CLI makes it super easy:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
# Or for other types:
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

This will create the necessary files and add them to your project.

### 2. Deploying the app

To build the project for production and deploy it to github pages, simply run:

```powershell
npm run deploy
```

This will compile everything into the `dist/` directory, optimized for production and deploy the entire app to github pages.

### 3. Running Unit Tests

Make sure your code is solid by running the unit tests:

```bash
ng test
```

This will run the tests using **Karma** and output the results to the terminal.

### 4. Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

For a full application test (from the userâ€™s perspective), run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

This will run the end-to-end tests using your chosen platform. If you havenâ€™t set it up yet, make sure to install the necessary dependencies for E2E testing.
