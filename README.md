## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

Start by cloning the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conji.git
cd conji
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the projectâ€™s dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Run the app locally with the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open your browser and visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app should automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

### 1. Code scaffolding

Need a new component, service, or module? Angular CLI makes it super easy:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
# Or for other types:
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

This will create the necessary files and add them to your project.

### 2. Deploying the app

To deploy a specific version of the app to GitHub Pages, simply create a new tag in your GitHub repository. This will automatically trigger the deployment workflow and publish the selected version to GitHub Pages.

You can access the deployed app [https://ruslanpr0g.github.io/CONJI/](here)

### 3. Running Unit Tests

Make sure your code is solid by running the unit tests:

```bash
ng test
```

This will run the tests using **Karma** and output the results to the terminal.
